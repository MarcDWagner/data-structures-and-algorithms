# Reverse an Array
Given a list, reverse it's order.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

The approach I took was to use reverse().  The big O for both the time and space is O(n) meaning that it will take more time and space as the input list gets bigger.  Reverse must iterate over each value in the list.
