## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I took the insert() approach because that was the most direct approach I could find within a reasonable amount of time.  I do intend to look further into the problem.  The insert only allows me to put the new value at a specific place in the list, it doesn't account for odd numbers in the list or edge cases or longer lists.  I think the big O approach for this is O(N), because the output is going to be almost as big as the input, just plus one from there.  So a larger input list will create a larger output list, both time and space.
