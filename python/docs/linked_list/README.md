# Singly Linked List
Creating a linked list for the first time.

## Challenge
To create a singly linked list, be able to create new nodes, insert new nodes, evaluate if a node value is present or not and return a string.

## Approach & Efficiency
The big O for this is O(1), because one input = one node.  Only one can be input at a time, so it takes the same amount of time and space.
## API
__iter__ to make the object iterable

insert() allows additional nodes to be inserted at the head of the linked list

includes() Checks if a value is present in the linked list or not, boolean return

__str__ to return a string of the nodes
